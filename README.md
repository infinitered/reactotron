# Introduction

Reactotron is a powerful debugger for React and React Native applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to monitor their application's **state, network requests, and performance metrics** and can be used for any size of project, from small personal apps to large-scale enterprise applications. The OG debugger [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) team uses on a day-to-day basis to build client apps. Additionally, Reactotron is completely open source and free to use, making it an invaluable tool for developers at all levels of experience.

We recommend to watch [Darin Wilson's](https://github.com/darinwilson) talk at [Chain React](https://chainreactconf.com/): [Chain React 2018: Debugging and Beyond with Reactotron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPo9A9k7xc)!

### Dev Tools

Make sure you've got at least `yarn` (1.7.0) and `node` (8.6.0).  There are some issues with older combos of these.  =)

Also if you encounter a problem with `electron 1.8.6` passing checksums, there was a bug in
earlier versions of node with their checksum process.  Clear your Yarn cache `yarn cache clean` to
grab the latests copies.

Clone & switch to the right branch.

```
git clone git@github.com:infinitered/reactotron.git
cd reactotron
