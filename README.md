# Introduction

Reactotron is a powerful desktop app for inspecting and debugging React and React Native applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to monitor their application's **state, network requests, and performance metrics** and can be used for any size of project, from small personal apps to large-scale enterprise applications. This is the debugger [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) team uses on a day-to-day basis to build client apps. Additionally, Reactotron is completely open source and free to use, making it an invaluable tool for developers at all levels of experience.

### Dev Tools

Make sure you've got at least `yarn` (1.7.0) and `node` (8.6.0).  There are some issues with older combos of these.  =)

Also if you encounter a problem with `electron 1.8.6` passing checksums, there was a bug in
earlier versions of node with their checksum process.  Clear your Yarn cache `yarn cache clean` to
grab the latests copies.

```
git clone git@github.com:infinitered/reactotron.git
