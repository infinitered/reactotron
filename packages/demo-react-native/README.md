# React Native + Reactotron Demo

### About the dependencies

`socket.io` is installed as a dependency because `reactotron-react-native` is
not installed quite the same as the other dependencies for this repo only.

You won't have this requirement on your own projects.  This is only important
for those of you who want to run this demo within this project.

Cobbler's shoes.  Or something.
