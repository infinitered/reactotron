# Installing the Application

### Via Direct Download

On the [Releases](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/releases) page, you can find the latest version of:

* macOS
* Linux (32-bit & 64-bit)
* Windows (32-bit & 64-bit)

### Via Homebrew

**NOTE**: When we submit an update to brew, it can take several hours before they merge it in.  Checkout the releases page to grab the latest binary in the meantime.

Reactotron is also available via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) package manager. To ensure you get the latest version, update Homebrew first:

```sh
brew update
```

Then simply type:

```
brew cask install reactotron
```

To update an existing installation of reactotron via brew, type:

```
brew cask reinstall reactotron
```

After a successful `brew cask install`, you can find the app in your **Applications** folder. Run it like any other application. :sparkles:
