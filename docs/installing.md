Reactotron comes in two versions.  A desktop version and a CLI.

# Installing the OS X Application

### Via Direct Download

[Download OS X App](https://github.com/reactotron/reactotron/releases/download/v1.1.4/Reactotron.app.zip) from GitHub release and drop the Reactotron.app to the Applications folder.

### Via Homebrew

Reactotron is also available via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) package manager. To ensure you get the latest version, update Homebrew first:

```sh
brew update
```

Then simply type:

```
brew cask install reactotron
```

# Install the CLI

If you like to kick it old-school and use the terminal, Reactotron is available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

To install globally:

```sh
npm install -g reactotron-cli
```

In order to pickup updates going forward, you can type the same command again.
