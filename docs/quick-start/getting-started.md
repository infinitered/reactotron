# Getting started with Reactotron

## Installing Reactotron

Reactotron exists as a desktop application (written in electron) that communicates with your react or react-native app over websockets. It's available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

First, you'll need to install the Reactotron desktop application. On the [Releases](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/releases?q=reactotron-app&expanded=true) page, you will find `reactotron-app` release where you can download the latest version.

Once installed, you need to add the Reactotron client to your project. Follow one of these quick start guides to get Reactotron up and running in your project:

- [**React Native**](./react-native.md#installing-reactotronapp)
- [**React**](./react-js.md#installing-reactotronapp)

If you run into an [issue](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/issues/1140) opening the application on Mac you can install with Homebrew instead: `brew install --cask reactotron`

## Where can I find more information?

We recommend that you watch [Darin Wilson's](https://github.com/darinwilson) talk at [Chain React](https://chainreactconf.com/): [Chain React 2018: Debugging and Beyond with Reactotron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPo9A9k7xc)!
