# AsyncStorage

The `asyncStorage` plugin is part of `reactotron-react-native` which allows you to track [AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html) on React Native.

## Usage

To use the Async Storage plugin, add the additional plugin on the `import` line.

```js
import Reactotron, { asyncStorage } from "reactotron-react-native"
```

Next, add it as a plugin to Reactotron.

```js
Reactotron.configure()
  .use(asyncStorage()) // <--- here we go!
  .connect()
```

And you're done! Now you can see your AsyncStorage in Reactotron.

## Advanced Usage

`asyncStorage()` also accepts an object with an `ignore` key. The value is an array of strings you would like to prevent sending to Reactotron.

```js
asyncStorage({
  ignore: ["secret"],
})
```
