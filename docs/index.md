## What is Reactotron?

Reactotron is a powerful debugger for React and React Native applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to monitor their application's **state, network requests, and performance metrics** and can be used for any size of project, from small personal apps to large-scale enterprise applications.

It has a powerful plugin system that allows developers to extend and enhance the capabilities of Reactotron.

You can use Reactotron to:

- view your application state
- show API requests & responses
- perform quick performance benchmarks
- subscribe to parts of your application state
- display messages similar to `console.log`
- track global errors with source-mapped stack traces including saga stack traces!
- dispatch actions like a government-run mind control experiment
- hot swap your app's state using Redux or mobx-state-tree
- track your sagas
- show image overlay in React Native
- track your Async Storage in React Native

You plug it into your app as a development dependency so it adds nothing to your production build size.

> Reactotron is completely open source and free to use, making it an invaluable tool for developers at all levels of experience.
