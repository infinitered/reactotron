# Getting started with Reactotron

## Installing Reactotron

Reactotron exists as a desktop application (written in electron) that communicates with your react or react-native app over websockets. It's available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

First, you'll need to install the Reactotron desktop application. You can find the latest version on the [Releases](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/releases?q=reactotron-app&expanded=true) page.

Once installed, you need to add the Reactotron client to your project. Follow one of these quick start guides to get Reactotron up and running in your project:

- [**React Native**](./quick-start/react-native.md#installing-reactotronapp)
- [**React**](./quick-start/react-js.md#installing-reactotronapp)

## Where can I find more information?

We recommend that you watch [Darin Wilson's](https://github.com/darinwilson) talk at [Chain React](https://chainreactconf.com/): [Chain React 2018: Debugging and Beyond with Reactotron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPo9A9k7xc)!
