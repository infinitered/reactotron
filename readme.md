A CLI and OS X app for inspecting your [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps.

# Download

[Download OS X App](https://github.com/reactotron/reactotron/releases/download/v1.0.0/Reactotron.app.zip) from GitHub...

Or Install CLI with:

```
npm install -g reactotron-cli
```


# About

Use it to:

* view your application state
* show API requests & responses
* perform quick performance benchmarks
* subscribe to parts of your application state
* display messages similar to console.log
* track global errors with source-mapped stack traces
* dispatch actions like a government-run mind control experiment

You plug it into your app as a dev dependency so it adds nothing to your product builds.

The app comes in two forms:

### Desktop

Reactotron on the left, demo React Native app on the right.
