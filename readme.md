 # Upgrading from v1?
 Make sure your `reactotron-*` dependencies match the version of the Reactotron app.  For example `reactotron-react-native@2` will
only work with the `2.x` version of the app.
 [Version 1.x](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/tree/v1.x) is located here if you're looking for what's currently shipping!
 `reactotron-react-native@2` requires `react-native >= 0.54`.  If you need, an older version, checkout the 1.x branch.
 # What is Reactotron?
 A macOS, Windows, and Linux app for inspecting your [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps.
 Use it to:
 * view your application state
* show API requests & responses
* perform quick performance benchmarks
* subscribe to parts of your application state
* display messages similar to `console.log`
* track global errors with source-mapped stack traces including saga stack traces!
* dispatch actions like a government-run mind control experiment
* hot swap your app's state using Redux or mobx-state-tree
* track your sagas
* show image overlay in React Native
* track your Async Storage in React Native
 You plug it into your app as a dev dependency so it adds nothing to your product builds.
