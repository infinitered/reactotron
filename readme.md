# ![CLI](./docs/images/readme/Reactotron-64.png) Reactotron

Reactotron is a developer tool which allows you to peak under the kilt of your [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps.


Use it to:

* view your application state
* show API requests & responses
* perform quick performance benchmarks
* subscribe to parts of your application state
* display messages similar to console.log
* track global errors with source-mapped stack traces
* dispatch actions like a government-run mind control experiment

You plug it into your app as a dev dependency so it adds nothing to your product builds.

The app comes in two forms:

### Desktop

Reactotron on the left, demo React Native app on the right.

### Command Line
