# What is Reactotron?

Reactotron is a macOS, Windows, and Linux app for inspecting your [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) apps.

_Watch [Darin Wilson's](https://github.com/darinwilson) talk at [Chain React](https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf): [Chain React 2018: Debugging and Beyond with Reactotron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiPo9A9k7xc)!_

Use it to:

- view your application state
- show API requests & responses
- perform quick performance benchmarks
- subscribe to parts of your application state
- display messages similar to `console.log`
- track global errors with source-mapped stack traces including saga stack traces!
- dispatch actions like a government-run mind control experiment
- hot swap your app's state using Redux or mobx-state-tree
- track your sagas
- show image overlay in React Native
- track your Async Storage in React Native

You plug it into your app as a dev dependency so it adds nothing to your product builds.
