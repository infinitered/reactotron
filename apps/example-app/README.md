# Welcome to the Reactotron Example App

The sole purpose of this app is to aid in developing Reactotron. It contains an example configuration and code for exercising the functionality of Reactotron's packages.

The example app was generated with [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite); the boilerplate that [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) uses as a way to test bleeding-edge changes to our React Native stack.

## Quick Start

[!IMPORTANT]
Before you start, run `yarn` in the root directory of the repo to make sure all of the dependencies have been installed successfully.

1. From the parent directory, run `yarn build && yarn start` This will build the latest version of Reactotron and open it.
2. From the parent directory, run `yarn start:example` or inside of example app directory `yarn start`. (Check the example app's `package.json` for additional options.)
3. Select the host platform you'd like to build for.
4. Once the build has completed, there should be a connection on the home screen of Reactotron from the example app.
